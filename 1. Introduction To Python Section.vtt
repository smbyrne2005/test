Welcome to Section 13 of the complete web developer course I hope you enjoyed working with a team of

00:06.800 --> 00:13.530
5 and CSSA three and seeing some of the great features that we can use from those in our web sites and

00:13.530 --> 00:19.200
web apps in this section we're going to return it to a server side language and we're going to be looking

00:19.200 --> 00:21.480
specifically at Python.

00:21.480 --> 00:27.630
Python is a great language for new coders to learn because it's so clean and well-thought-out.

00:27.750 --> 00:33.030
We can also use it on a huge range of different platforms that works on a web server but you can also

00:33.030 --> 00:40.110
use it on say a Raspberry Pi or an order window to allow you to build Internet of things experiences

00:40.350 --> 00:41.760
for your users.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.950
So it should be pretty straightforward to get to grips with.

00:44.070 --> 00:48.960
We'll start with the basics of how Python works and how you get a Python script up and running and then

00:48.990 --> 00:54.630
we'll go on to look at some of the specific Python features and we'll be making a fun game with Python

00:54.690 --> 00:55.380
as well.

00:56.300 --> 01:00.190
So enjoy the section and as always I'll see at the beginning of the next one.
